# Pride Art 2022 :rainbow: :two_hearts:
*This document is subject to change.*

This game is part of a norwegian [pride art](https://www.prideart.no) project under the submission of [PKI](https://kjonnsinkongruens.no/). The only known requirements at the time of writing is that it should represent the organizations members with a 'pro-trans' theme.
This will be done with symbols and other imagry, and hopefully through gameplay.

Release date will be sometime mid-april.

This game will be for desktop only, and is best played with a controller. The game will be displayed among other art using a pc, screen and controllers.

The language of the game will be norwegian and/or english.
Number of players might be two.

## Game Design Document :sparkling_heart:

1. Overall Vision :blue_heart:
    * **Write a short paragraph explaining the game:**
    
        Top down bullet hell dogder. The players control an avatar from above and needs to dogde incomming attacks with various actions.
            
    * **Describe the genre:**

        Bullet hell dodger
        
    * **What is the target audience?**

        The average player is assumed to be casually playing for a couple or minutes. It's also presumed there will be more spectators than players. The game is appropriate for children older than 8 (maybe?), although average age is deduced to be 20-30.

        Therefore I'm wanting to create a game taht is fast and easy to enjoy, and that has visible pride and trans imagry and symbols.
        
    * **Why play this game?**

        The challenge presented is to survive an ongoing bullet hell. Players may take multiple actions to do so, scaling with the difficulty.
        The game is also wanting to bring forth the feeling of community and preserverance with being LGBTQAI, especially transgender.
    
2. Mechanics: the rules of the game world :purple_heart:
    * **What are the character's goals?**

        To survive an ongoing bullet hell.
        (And also rescue other rainbow characters?)
           
    * **What abilities does the character have?**
        
        This is subject to change. A controller have four iconic buttons:
        * Dodge: swoop forward, momentarily becoming invoulnrable.
        * shield
        * ?
        * Boom! cleared the screen (with the help of allies?)
        
    * **What obstacles or difficulties will the character face?**

        Multiple enemies with different abilities presenting interesting gameplay. Picking up experience points and leveling up.
        
    * **What items can the character obtain**

        No items, but perhaps abilities will be available after earning some experience points?
        
    * **What resources must be managed?**

        Experience points, health points, cool down on actions, (saving other characters?)    
        
 3. Dynamics: the interaction between the player and the game mechanics :heart:
    * **What hardware is required by the game?** 

        * Desktop needs to have a functional mouse, keyboard and screen. Controllers are also supported. This game will not require a powerful computer.
        
    * **What type of proficiency will the player need to develop to become proficient at the game?**

        Physical Coordination Challenges:
        * Speed and reaction time
        * Accuracy and Precision
        * Learning which actions to best solve the immediate challenge
       
    * **What gameplay data is displayed during the game?**

        Life hearts, and an experience progression bar. (Possibly a combo counter?)
    
    * **What menus, screens, or overlays will there be?**

        * A splash screen showing the author of the game.        
        * A menu screen showing play and options (maybe also the logo of PKI?). 
        * The options screen feature both a music slider and an audio slider.
        * Game over screen
   
    * **How does the player interact with the game at the software level?**

        The player is offered the buttons of a standard controller.

        As for now the left stick and pad will be used for movements, and the 4 colored buttons for actions. 'A' will be the dodge button.
    
4. Aesthetics: the visual, audio, narrative, and psychological aspects of the game :green_heart:
    * **Describe the style and feel of the game.**
        
        Fast paced, simple graphics, classical video-game esthetics.
   
    * **Does the game use pixel art, line art, or realistic graphics?**
    
        Cute pixel art with a minimalistic palette.
        
    * **What style of background music, ambient sounds will the game use?**
    
        Upbeat chiptune music fit for fast action.
       
    * **What is the relevant backstory for the game?**

        The player controls a transgendered character (possibly chaning gender when performing actions?) fighting for their right to exist in ongoing a barrage of attempts to remove them, (and saving other characters?)    
        
    * **What emotional state(s) does the game try to provoke?**

        A fast and exciting can-do attitude to master the gameplay. Anger towards enemies, (and solidarity towards characters to be saved?)
       
    * **What makes the game fun?**

        Mastering the gameplay with its fast paced challenges, intentions and actions.
        And engaging in transgender pride art.
        
5. Development :sparkles:
    
    * **List the team members and their roles, responsibilities, and skills.**  
      
        This project will be completed individually; graphics and audio will be obtained from third-party websites that make their assets available under the Creative Commons license, and so the main task will be programming and creating some graphics.
    
    * **What equipment is needed for this project?**   

        A computer (with keyboard, mouse, and speakers) and internet access will be necessary to complete this project.
    
    * **What are the tasks that need to be accomplished to create this game?**    
        
        This project will use a simple Kanban board hosted on the project's GitHub page.
        The main sequence of steps to complete this project is as follows:    
        * Setting up a project scaffold
        * **Programming game mechanics and UI**
        * **Creating and obtaining graphical assets**
        * Obtaining audio assets
        * Controller support
        * **Polishing**
        * Deployment

    * **What points in the development process are suitable for playtesting?**    
        
        The main points for playtesting are when the basic game mechanics of the level screen are implemented, and when it is visualised. The questions that will be asked are:         
        * Is the gameplay and UI understandable?
        * Is the gameplay interesting?
        * How do the controls feel?
        * How is the pace of the game?
        * Are there any improvement suggestions?        
    
    * **What are the plans for publication?**
        
        This game will be made available for free on desktop. It will be advertised to various indie game-portal websites (LibGDX, Reddit, ...). Gameplay images and a trailer video will be posted and marketed via social media.
